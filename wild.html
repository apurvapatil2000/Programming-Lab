				<article><p align="left" style="color: grey">
					Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.<br>
					Indian wild forest and national parks are home to many species of wild animals,birds and reptiles. More than 25% land of Indian states are covered with dense forest and provide shelter to the wildlife.<br>
					List of big wild animals found in India are The Royal Bengal Tiger, Asiatic Elephant, Great Indian Rhino, The Asiatic Lion, Indian Leopard, Indian giant squirrel, Indian wild Bore, Indian wild Ass, Black Buck, and Nilgai. India also boasts of a large number of reptiles that include venomous species of snakes and giant lizards.

				<h1>1.Tiger</h1>
				<label>Name: <b>Panthera tigris</b></label><br><br>
				<article><p align="left">
					The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest extant cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange-brown fur with a lighter underside. It is an apex predator, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years, before they become independent and leave their mother's home range to establish their own.

				<article><p align="left">
					The Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is one of three extant recognised subspecies of the Asian elephant and native to mainland Asia.
					Since 1986, the Asian elephant has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List as the wild population has declined by at least 50% since the 1930s to 1940s, i.e. three elephant generations. The Asian elephant is threatened by habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation.
					The Indian elephant is native to mainland Asia: India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Laos, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam. It is regionally extinct in Pakistan. It inhabits grasslands, dry deciduous, moist deciduous, evergreen and semi-evergreen forests.

				<h1>3.Indian Rhinoceros</h1>
				<label>Name: <b> Rhinoceros unicornis</b></label><br><br>
				<article><p align="left">
					The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), also called the Indian rhino, greater one-horned rhinoceros or great Indian rhinoceros, is a rhinoceros species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as populations are fragmented and restricted to less than 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi). Moreover, the extent and quality of the rhino's most important habitat, the alluvial Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands and riverine forest, is considered to be in decline due to human and livestock encroachment. As of 2008, a total of 2,575 mature individuals were estimated to live in the wild.

Historically, it inhabited much of Western Asia and the Middle East up to northern India. On the IUCN Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy.
