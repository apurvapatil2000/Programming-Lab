		<h2>Description of WWW terms:</h2>
		<dl>
			<dt>WWW</dt>
			<dd>A system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. The documents are formatted in a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language) that supports links to other documents, as well as graphics, audio, and video files. This means you can jump from one document to another simply by clicking on hot spots. Not all Internet servers are part of the World Wide Web. Short for World Wide Web Consortium, an international consortium of companies involved with the Internet and the Web. </dd>
			<dt>ISP</dt>
			<dd>Short for Internet Service Provider, a company that provides access to the Internet. For a monthly fee, the service provider gives you a software package, username, password and access phone number. Equipped with a modem, you can then log on to the Internet and browse the World Wide Web and USENET, and send and receive e-mail. In addition to serving individuals, ISPs also serve large companies, providing a direct connection from the company's networks to the Internet. ISPs themselves are connected to one another through Network Access Points (NAPs). ISPs are also called IAPs (Internet Access Providers).</dd>
			<dt>Browser</dt>
			<dd>Short for Web browser, a software application used to locate and display Web pages. The two most popular browsers are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both of these are graphical browsers, which means that they can display graphics as well as text. In addition, most modern browsers can present multimedia information, including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats.</dd>
			<dt>URL</dt>
			<dd>URLs make it possible to direct both people and software applications to a variety of information, available from a number of different Internet protocols. Abbreviation of Uniform Resource Locator, the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. The first part of the address indicates what protocol to use, and the second part specifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located.</dd>
			<dt>hypertext</dt>
			<dd>Hypertext simply means non linear text. A novel or magazine article is an example of linear text because it is meant to be read from beginning to end. Non linear communication is much harder to create because you must allow for the possibility of each reader accessing the material in a different order.</dd>
			<dt>HTML</dt>
			<dd>Short for HyperText Markup Language, the authoring language used to create documents on the World Wide Web. Hypertext, for easy navigation among resources (e.g. HyperText Markup Language or HTML, a standard format for describing the structure of documents for transmission of hypermedia documents). HTML documents are ASCII files with embedded codes for logical markup, format (text styles, document titles, paragraphs, tables) and hyperlinks.
